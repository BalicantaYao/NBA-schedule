# 2013-2014 NBA Schedule

A few days ago the 2013-2-14 NBA schedule was released so here it is by team in JSON format by team. It was gently scraped from ESPN.com.

CSV copies coming soon.

I've included instances in which a game will be on national TV as announced at this point. There will probably be more announced later and I'll update the datasets then.

The files are pretty big since I leaned towards including more data than less but it shouldn't be too hard to run the `scripts/get_schedule.py` file, excluding the data you don't need. Start [here](https://github.com/davewalk/2013-2014-nba-schedule/blob/master/scripts/get_schedules.py#L121).
